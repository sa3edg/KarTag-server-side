# KarTag-server-side
The server side of KarTag startup.

KarTag is a reliable, trustworthy and social carpooling mobile app . We believe that everyone should have access to affordable and reliable transport, and that being on the road can still be cheap, green and fun. KarTag helps reduce heavy levels of environmental pollution, traffic and parking problems while encouraging hanging out with old and meeting new friends.

KarTag is a carpooling application, initially launched on Android and ios phones, that comes as close to solving the matter of trust as possible. It rides on top of existing cultural values and behavioral patterns. Egyptians are very social and love talking and interacting while being in a car. Using KarTag, a user can carpool – or kartag as we call it – with his/her Facebook friends and Facebook friends’ friends. In either case, a user is either carpooling with a real-life friend or has a real-life friend in common with the fellow carpooler. Egypt is also a country of communities and groups, which KarTag leverages by offering its services for national universities (AUC, GUC, Heliopolis University, etc.), science and technology parks (Smart Village) that host many companies as well as big malls and shopping centers (CityStars). Not too digress completely from conventional carpooling approaches, KarTag allows to carpool from and to big populated areas (Mohandesseen, downtown)
